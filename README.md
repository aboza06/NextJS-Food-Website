<h1>Next.js Foodie Website Project</h1>

This project is part of a comprehensive learning experience in full-stack engineering. It allowed me to apply and deepen my understanding of both frontend and backend development using React, Next.js, and SQL.

<h3>Project Overview</h3>

The Next.js Foodie Website is a dynamic platform where users can browse and share recipes. It features a modern, responsive design and demonstrates my ability to build full-stack applications from scratch.

<h3>Technologies Used</h3>

- **Frontend**: Built using React and Next.js, leveraging server-side rendering and dynamic routing.
- **Backend**: Developed with SQLite for data storage, with SQL queries to manage and retrieve data.
- **Styling**: Implemented using CSS Modules for scoped and maintainable styles.

<h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>

- **Full-Stack Development**: Gained hands-on experience in both frontend and backend development.
- **React & Next.js**: Mastered component-based architecture, dynamic routing, and server-side rendering.
- **SQL**: Developed and managed a SQL database, learning how to integrate it with a Next.js application.
